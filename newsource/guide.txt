I have gone through a hard time, suffering from sort of extreme negative feelings. Sometimes I even want to kill myself. I am also concerned about myself and trying to cope with these feelings. Therefore, as soon as I felt better, I decided to keep a diary to record my feelings. Perhaps it will help to improve my situation. This post is meant to be written in time order, that is, later texts go below.
I'm not sure why I feel this way. Maybe I need some help, but not now, when COVID19 is striking the whole country.
I don't know what it was that made me suddenly excited. But it seems that the blues are still somewhere around me, and may come back at any time.
I tried to convince myself that I am talented and that I should continue living. It might be working.
Anyhow I hope to find a way through.
At the time of writing the "e" tag is a work in progress.

The bad feeling is back. But this time it's quite mild.
I'm 2 lazy 2 get "e" tag fixed.
