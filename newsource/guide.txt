[h1]Q&A[/h1]
[h2]What's this?[/h2]
To be honest it's a diary.
I have gone through a hard time, suffering from sort of extreme negative feelings. I am also concerned about myself and trying to cope with these feelings. Therefore, as soon as I felt better, I decided to keep a diary to record my feelings. Perhaps it will help to improve my situation. This post is meant to be written in time order, that is, later texts go below.
[h2]Are you [del]suicidal[/del]?[/h2]
Sometimes I [del]want to kill myself[/del], sometimes not.
I'm not sure why I feel this way. Maybe I need some help, but not now, when COVID19 is striking the whole country.

I don't know what it was that made me suddenly excited. But it seems that the blues are still somewhere around me, and may come back at any time.
I tried to convince myself that I am talented and that I should continue living. It might be working.
Anyhow I hope to find a way through.
At the time of writing the "e" tag is a work in progress.

In the afternoon: The bad feeling is back. But this time it's quite mild.
I'm 2 lazy 2 get "e" tag fixed
In the evening: Thinking about the future, I find it hard.
Finally I've got the "e" tag working.
Then I'm feeling calm. All these in these two days seem much milder than what I have previously experienced. I don't know what causes such distress (Maybe it's because failure in OI or failure(really?) in exams), but things are starting to get better.
I remember one equation very clearly. $2H^++Cl^-+ClO^-=Cl_2\uparrow+2H_2O$. In the meantime, I'd rather forget it. If I forget it, I may fail in solving a few problems. If I remember it, maybe I'll [del]die[/del]. (Remember the great pain a few days ago? Well, watch out!) Just joking.
Fxck dingding.

Still struggling.
I spent too much time worrying about myself. Will I get better? Or will I get stuck with the random change of moods?
Perhaps I'm overly worried :-P
Perhaps I spent too much time thinking about my situation. Perhaps I just need to take a break from "thinking about thinking" and focus on my work. Such thinking pattern began when I was taking my final exams. However, things seemed to be wrong before that.

These were my thoughts in the past.
[h3]"I'm so weak."[/h3]
Because of the class that I'm in, others think that I'm just pretending to be weak. But I was really feeling this way. I just couldn't help saying that.
One day, when I was in the MO class, I thought that first I failed in OI and then I couldn't do well in MO. At that time, it seemed that everything around me turned dark. I couldn't help crying.

[h3]"What's the point of life?"[/h3]
It seemed that I havr had suicidal thoughts since a few weeks after the mid-term exam, but I have never asked for help. Perhaps it's too embarrasing that I want to hide it even when I feel well.

Perhaps that's the reason why I'm more interested in chlorine than other elements. Perhaps this could explain why my chemistry was unaffected -- I was looking for suicide methods.
[/del]

It seems that things are changing for the better. I'm determined to get better.

Excited!
Perhaps there were no debugging tools when God created the world. The human mind certainly has a lot of bugs!
