<a name="bm2"></a><h2>What's this?</h2><br>
To be honest it's a diary.<br>
I have gone through a hard time, suffering from sort of extreme negative feelings. I am also concerned about myself and trying to cope with these feelings. Therefore, as soon as I felt better, I decided to keep a diary to record my feelings. Perhaps it will help to improve my situation. This post is meant to be written in time order, that is, later texts go below.<br>
<a name="bm3"></a><h2>Are you <del>suicidal</del>?</h2><br>
Sometimes I <del>want to kill myself</del>, sometimes not.<br>
I'm not sure why I feel this way. Maybe I need some help, but not now, when COVID19 is striking the whole country.<br>
<a name="bm4"></a><h1>Content</h1><br>
<div class="emotion good">2020 02 14 :-)</div><br>
I don't know what it was that made me suddenly excited. But it seems that the blues are still somewhere around me, and may come back at any time.<br>
I tried to convince myself that I am talented and that I should continue living. It might be working.<br>
Anyhow I hope to find a way through.<br>
At the time of writing the &quot;e&quot; tag is a work in progress.<br>
<div class="emotion soso">2020 02 15 :-|</div><br>
In the afternoon: The bad feeling is back. But this time it's quite mild.<br>
I'm 2 lazy 2 get &quot;e&quot; tag fixed<br>
In the evening: Thinking about the future, I find it hard.<br>
Finally I've got the &quot;e&quot; tag working.<br>
Then I'm feeling calm. All these in these two days seem much milder than what I have previously experienced. I don't know what causes such distress (Maybe it's because failure in OI or failure(really?) in exams), but things are starting to get better.<br>
I remember one equation very clearly. $2H^++Cl^-+ClO^-=Cl_2\uparrow+2H_2O$. In the meantime, I'd rather forget it. If I forget it, I may fail in solving a few problems. If I remember it, maybe I'll <del>die</del>. (Remember the great pain a few days ago? Well, watch out!) Just joking.<br>
Fxck dingding.<br>
<div class="emotion soso">2020 02 15 :-|</div><br>
Still struggling.<br>
I spent too much time worrying about myself. Will I get better? Or will I get stuck with the random change of moods?<br>
Perhaps I'm overly worried :-P<br>
Perhaps I spent too much time thinking about my situation. Perhaps I just need to take a break from &quot;thinking about thinking&quot; and focus on my work. Such thinking pattern began when I was taking my final exams. However, things seemed to be wrong before that.<br>
<br>
These were my thoughts in the past.<br>
<a name="bm5"></a><h3>&quot;I'm so weak.&quot;</h3><br>
Because of the class that I'm in, others think that I'm just pretending to be weak. But I was really feeling this way. I just couldn't help saying that.<br>
One day, when I was in the MO class, I thought that first I failed in OI and then I couldn't do well in MO. At that time, it seemed that everything around me turned dark. I couldn't help crying.<br>
<del><br>
<a name="bm6"></a><h3>&quot;What's the point of life?&quot;</h3><br>
It seemed that I havr had suicidal thoughts since a few weeks after the mid-term exam, but I have never asked for help. Perhaps it's too embarrasing that I want to hide it even when I feel well.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that's the reason why I'm more interested in chlorine than other elements. Perhaps this could explain why my chemistry was unaffected -- I was looking for suicide methods.<br>
</del><br>
<br>
It seems that things are changing for the better. I'm determined to get better.<br>
<div class="emotion good">2020 02 16 :-)</div><br>
Excited!<br>
Perhaps there were no debugging tools when God created the world. The human mind certainly has a lot of bugs!<br>
