I have gone through a hard time, suffering from sort of extreme negative feelings. Sometimes I even want to kill myself. I am also concerned about myself and trying to cope with these feelings. Therefore, as soon as I felt better, I decided to keep a diary to record my feelings. Perhaps it will help to improve my situation. This post is meant to be written in time order, that is, later texts go below.<br>
I'm not sure why I feel this way. Maybe I need some help, but not now, when COVID19 is striking the whole country.<br>
I don't know what it was that made me suddenly excited. But it seems that the blues are still somewhere around me, and may come back at any time.<br>
I tried to convince myself that I am talented and that I should continue living. It might be working.<br>
Anyhow I hope to find a way through.<br>
At the time of writing the &quot;e&quot; tag is a work in progress.<br>
<div class="emotion soso">2020 02 15 :|</div><br>
In the afternoon: The bad feeling is back. But this time it's quite mild.<br>
I'm 2 lazy 2 get &quot;e&quot; tag fixed<br>
In the evening: Thinking about the future, I find it hard.<br>
Finally I've got the &quot;e&quot; tag working.<br>
Calm. All these in these two days seem much milder than what I have previously experienced. I don't know what causes such distress (Maybe it's because failure in OI or failure(really?) in exams), but things are starting to get better.<br>
I remember one equation very clearly. $2H^++Cl^-+ClO^-=Cl_2\uparrow+2H_2O$. In the meantime, I'd rather forget it. If I forget it, I may fail in solving a few problems. If I remember it, maybe I'll die. (Remember the great pain a few days ago? Well, watch out!) Just joking.<br>
